# karpathy-makemore-tutorial
I put code here that is the result of practicing with Andrej Karpathy's makemore tutorial

## current goal
to beat a dev loss of 2.17  
(I thought I beat it, with 2.13, but I somehow can't reproduce it. even though I wrote down the hyperparameters: emb 4 context 4 batch 800 hidden 400 iterations 20k)
